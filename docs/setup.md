# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** — `claude` must be on PATH
- **Python 3.10+** — with `rich` library for supervisor TUI
- **tmux** — for worker panes (`brew install tmux`)
- **gh CLI** — for GitHub issue tracking (`brew install gh`)
- **Git**

```bash
# Install Python deps (first time)
pip install -r octobots/scripts/requirements.txt
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone into your project
cd /path/to/your-project
git clone git@github.com:onetest-ai/octobots.git octobots

# Or as a submodule
git submodule add git@github.com:onetest-ai/octobots.git octobots

# Initialize project runtime
octobots/scripts/init-project.sh
```

This creates `.octobots/` with:
- `board.md` — team whiteboard
- `memory/` — per-role persistent learnings
- `roles/` — project-specific role overrides
- `skills/` — project-specific skills
- `workers/` — isolated environments for code workers (multi-repo)
- `relay.db` — taskbox database

## First Run: Scout

```bash
octobots/start.sh scout
```

Kit explores the codebase and generates:
- `AGENTS.md` — project context all roles read
- `.agents/profile.md` — project card
- `.agents/conventions.md` — detected coding standards
- `.agents/architecture.md` — system design map
- `.agents/testing.md` — test infrastructure

## Running the Team

Two terminals:

**Terminal 1 — Supervisor** (Rich TUI + all workers in tmux):
```bash
octobots/supervisor.sh
```

The supervisor:
- Launches all workers as Claude Code instances in tmux panes
- Polls taskbox and routes tasks to workers
- Provides an interactive command prompt

**Terminal 2 — Telegram bridge**:
```bash
venv/bin/python octobots/scripts/telegram-bridge.py
```

### Supervisor Commands

```
/status              Worker states and last output
/workers             Panes, sources (base/project), environments
/tasks               Taskbox stats (pending/processing/done)
/logs <role> [N]     Last N lines from a worker's pane
/send <role> <msg>   Send a message directly to a worker
/restart <role|all>  Exit + relaunch a worker
/clear <role>        Send /clear to a worker
/board               Show team board (BOARD.md)
/health              System health check
/schedule            Schedule a one-shot or recurring job
/loop                Shortcut for /schedule every
/jobs                List or manage scheduled jobs
/stop                Graceful shutdown
/help                Command reference
```

### Scheduling & Loops

The supervisor can run jobs on a schedule — send messages to workers, run shell commands, or invoke agents. Same `@role` syntax as Telegram.

```bash
# Send a recurring task to a role
/schedule every 30m @pm Check status of all tasks
/schedule every 1h @qa Run regression tests on staging

# One-shot at a specific time
/schedule at 15:00 @py Review PR #42

# Cron expressions (5-field: min hour dom month dow)
/schedule cron 0 9 * * MON-FRI @ba Daily standup report

# Run a shell command on an interval
/schedule every 1h run git fetch --all

# Invoke a Claude Code agent
/schedule every 30m agent rca-investigator Check flaky tests

# /loop is a shortcut for /schedule every
/loop 30m @pm Check task progress
/loop 5m run ./scripts/health-check.sh
```

Manage jobs:
```bash
/jobs                    # List all scheduled jobs
/jobs cancel <id>        # Remove a job
/jobs pause <id>         # Temporarily disable
/jobs resume <id>        # Re-enable a paused job
```

Jobs are persisted to `.octobots/schedule.json` and survive supervisor restarts.

### Worker Self-Restart

Workers can request their own restart via taskbox. This is useful when new skills or agents have been added and the worker needs to pick them up (Claude Code discovers skills/agents at session start).

From inside a worker session:
```bash
python3 octobots/skills/taskbox/scripts/relay.py send --from $OCTOBOTS_ID --to supervisor "restart"
```

The supervisor picks up the request on the next poll cycle (within 15s), sends `/exit` to the worker's pane, and relaunches it fresh.

### Watching Workers in tmux

```bash
# All workers tiled in one view
tmux attach -t octobots

# Inside tmux:
# Ctrl+B, q     — show pane numbers, press number to select
# Ctrl+B, z     — zoom into current pane (toggle)
# Ctrl+B, d     — detach (everything keeps running)
```

### Interactive Mode (single role)

For debugging or talking to one role directly:
```bash
octobots/start.sh python-dev
octobots/start.sh --list
```

## Telegram Setup

### 1. Create a bot
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot`, follow prompts
3. Copy the bot token

### 2. Get your user ID
1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. Copy your user ID

### 3. Configure `.env.octobots`

```bash
OCTOBOTS_TG_TOKEN=7123456789:AAHxxx...
OCTOBOTS_TG_OWNER=123456789
```

### 4. Run the bridge

```bash
pip install -r octobots/scripts/requirements.txt  # first time
python3 octobots/scripts/telegram-bridge.py
```

### 5. Usage

Messages go to PM (Max) by default. Use `@role` to address others:

```
what's the status?              → Max (PM)
@py fix the login bug           → Py
@qa test issue #103             → Sage
@tl decompose #100              → Rio
@ba clarify the auth story      → Alex
```

### Telegram Commands

All supervisor commands are available as Telegram slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Worker states and last output |
| `/tasks` | Taskbox queue stats |
| `/team` | List roles and aliases |
| `/logs <role>` | Last output from a worker |
| `/board` | Team whiteboard |
| `/health` | System health check |
| `/jobs` | List scheduled jobs |
| `/jobs cancel\|pause\|resume <id>` | Manage a job |
| `/schedule <type> <spec> @role msg` | Create a scheduled job |
| `/loop <interval> @role msg` | Recurring schedule shortcut |
| `/restart <role\|all>` | Restart a worker |
| `/help` | Full command reference |

Commands appear in Telegram's command menu (the `/` button).

```

**Resolution order:** `.octobots/roles/<role>/` (project overrides) takes priority over `.claude/agents/<role>/` (installed via `npx github:<repo> init`). `octobots/` is framework code only — re-running `install.sh` wipes and re-extracts it, so never put user data there.

## Configuration

All in `.env.octobots` (project root):

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `OCTOBOTS_TG_TOKEN` | For Telegram | — | Bot token from BotFather |
| `OCTOBOTS_TG_OWNER` | For Telegram | — | Your Telegram user ID |
| `OCTOBOTS_WORKERS` | No | auto-discover | Explicit worker list |
| `OCTOBOTS_EXCLUDED_ROLES` | No | `scout` | Roles to skip in supervisor |
| `OCTOBOTS_DB` | Auto-set | `.octobots/relay.db` | Taskbox database path |
| `OCTOBOTS_ID` | Auto-set | role name | Taskbox instance ID |

## MCP Servers

Configured in project root's `.mcp.json`. All roles share it. Contains API tokens — gitignore it.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": { "type": "stdio", "command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"] },
    "github": { "type": "http", "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN" } }
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Override an installed agent

```bash
# Copy the installed agent into .octobots/roles/ and edit there.
# .octobots/roles/ takes priority over .claude/agents/ of the same name.
cp -r .claude/agents/python-dev/ .octobots/roles/python-dev/
# Edit .octobots/roles/python-dev/AGENT.md with project-specific instructions.
```

### Add a custom role

Two paths:

- **Project-local:** create `.octobots/roles/my-role/AGENT.md` (+ `SOUL.md`). Auto-discovered on next supervisor restart.
- **Published agent:** create a GitHub repo following any existing `*-agent` repo's layout, then `npx github:<your>/<name>-agent init --all` to install into `.claude/agents/`.

### Add a project-specific skill

Published skills are installed via `npx skills add <repo>` into `.claude/skills/<name>/`. For a project-local skill, drop it directly into `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` — the supervisor picks it up on the next worker seed. See [docs/skill-spec.md](skill-spec.md).

## GitHub Integration

```bash
gh auth status    # verify auth
gh auth login     # if needed
```

All roles comment on issues automatically. Issues live in the platform repo, PRs go to specific repos.

## Troubleshooting

### Supervisor won't start
Run `/health` to check prerequisites. Install missing tools.

### Workers idle — not picking up tasks
1. `/tasks` — check if messages are pending
2. `/logs <role>` — check worker output
3. `/restart <role>` — relaunch the worker

### Duplicate work on restart
Stuck `processing` messages are marked `done` on restart (not re-queued). If you need to re-send, create a new task.

### Symlinks broken after clone
```bash
cd octobots
for role in roles/*/; do
  for skill in skills/*; do
    ln -sfn "../../../../$skill" "$role/.claude/skills/$(basename $skill)"
  done
done
```

### Worker can't find `.mcp.json`
In isolated environments (`.octobots/workers/<role>/`), `.mcp.json` is symlinked from project root. Verify: `ls -la .octobots/workers/python-dev/.mcp.json`
